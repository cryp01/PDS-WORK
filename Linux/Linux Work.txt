Download jan2017articles.csv and example.bed files to solve the next
questions.

Q1(1 point):
Take a look at the last 10 lines of the file. Which command are you going to use? 
Modify the command to show just the last line of the file.

tail jan2017articles.csv
tail -n1 jan2017articles.csv


Q2 (1p):
Extract all lines that belong to January 6th from the file and store them in a new file named “reyes.csv". Check that the first line of the new file has the expected values.

grep -i "^06 Jan" jan2017articles.csv > reyes.csv | head -n1 reyes.csv


Q3 (1p):
Use the original csv to find which entries have 0 at the comment count only for those entries from january 25th

awk -F ',' '$5 ~0' jan2017articles.csv | grep -i -n '^25 Jan'


Q4 (1p):
Now count the number of entries of Q3 and compare with the total number of entries 

awk -F ',' '$5 ~0' jan2017articles.csv | grep -i -n '^25 Jan' | wc -l
and 
wc -l jan2017articles.csv


Q5 (1p):
Now use example.bed file. In this file, we are interested in the exon sizes of each entry. They are located in field number 11. Now you have to get the exon sizes of the first 10 entries of the file.

cut -f11 example.bed | head


Q5 (1p):
How would you remove the last comma?

cut -f11 example.bed | sed -e 's/,$//' | head


Q6 (1p):
How would get the smallest size from each of the records? The result should provide a number for each line of the input
cut -f11 example.bed | sed -e 's/,/ /g' | awk '{m=$1;for(i=1;i<=NF;i++)if($i<m)m=$i;print m}' | head

Q7 (1p):
How would you now sort the records so that the first number shown is the smallest exon size? Again, the answer must provide a sorted list of numbers for each line of the input

cut -f11 example.bed | sed -e 's/,/ /g' | awk '{for (i=1;i<NF;i++){for(j=i+1;j<=NF;j++){if($i>$j){temp=$j;$j=$i;$i=temp}}}print}' | head


Q8 (1p):
Now Get the 10 largest exons of chr1 stored in example.bed.

cut -f1,11 example.bed | grep "^chr1" | cut -f2 | sed -e 's/,/ /g' | awk '{m=$1;for(i=1;i<=NF;i++)if($i>m)m=$i;print m}' | sort -n -r | uniq | head


Q9 (1p):
now modify Q8 script to receive as a parameter the number of exons to search for

A bash script with name q9.sh was created in order to give the user the possibility of giving a number.

#!/bin/bash
read -p  "Give the number of exons to search for:" number
echo "The $number largest exons of chr1 are:"
cut -f1,11 example.bed | grep "^chr1" |cut -f2 | sed -e 's/,/ /g' |
 awk '{m=$1;for(i=1;i<=NF;i++)if($i>m)m=$i;print m}' | sort -n -r | uniq | head -$number

Then we make our script executable with the command: chmode +x q9.sh
And afterwards we can run it: ./q9.sh


Q10 (1p):
Get the first 10 records of jan2017articles.csv with largest number of comments from the original csv file

sort -t, -k5 -n -r jan2017articles.csv | head


Q11 (1p):
Modify your previous script to receive a number as a parameter N and then show the top N entries with more comments

A bash script was created in order to give the user the possibility of giving a number.

#!/bin/bash
read -p  "Give the number of entries with more comments you want to print:" N
echo "The $N entries with the more comments are:"
sort -t, -n -r -k5 jan2017articles.csv | head -$N

Then we make our script executable with the command: chmode +x q11.sh
And we run it: ./q11.sh


Q12 (1p):
Now we are going to create a new articles.csv where we get a different output data layout using awk tool
INPUT: Post date,Content type,Author,Title,Comm count,Path,Tags,Word count
OUTPUT: Title;Comment count;Word count;Post date

awk -F, '{print $4"\t"$5"\t"$8"\t"$1}' jan2017articles.csv > newjan2017articles.csv


Q13 (1p):
Now create a new article2.csv format where we cut the Title text to 10 characters and we get only the last level of the Path

The new file can be created by creating two files and merge them together:

cut -d',' -f4 jan2017articles.csv | cut -c 1-10 > temp1.csv
cut -d',' -f6 jan2017articles.csv | awk -F/ '{print $NF}' > temp2.csv
paste -d, temp1.csv temp2.csv > article2.csv

Or without creating intermediate files:

cut -d',' -f4,6 jan2017articles.csv | awk -F, '{$1=substr($1,1,10)}1' OFS=, | awk -F, '{gsub(/.*\//,"",$2);print}' OFS=, > article2.csv
